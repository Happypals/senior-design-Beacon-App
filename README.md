This app uses Estimote beacons in development.

The two main beacons we use are the proximity beacons and the location beacons.

Proximity is about your apps detecting they’re near areas of interest. First, tag the area with a Proximity Beacon (Location Beacons work too), and call it something—e.g., “my desk.” From now on, Bluetooth-enabled devices such as iOS and Android smartphones can detect that it’s in proximity of your desk.

Indoor Location is about replicating the GPS technology, but indoors, where there’s no satellite coverage. Put up a whole bunch of Location Beacons throughout the space, and they will automatically map it out and create a floor plan—courtesy of the UWB radio they’re equipped with, and Estimote Automapping technology. From now on, your iOS and Android apps gain access to precise indoor (x,y) coordinates of the device.

Here's a link to a youtube video introducing how an indoor location beacons are configured and used:

All beacons are managed using an estimote account where you can add, personalize your beacons and know the activites and states of your beacon.

This app is a sample app that demos notification pushing of a proximity beacon
